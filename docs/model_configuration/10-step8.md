## Step 8: Publish your model component in the MINT Model Catalog

The final step submits the model component to the MINT model catalog. This way anyone will be able to execute it through DAME, or using Docker. In order to upload the component, just type:

`mic encapsulate step8`


### Expected results 
If everything goes well, now your component should be part of the MINT model catalog. You are done. Congratulations!
