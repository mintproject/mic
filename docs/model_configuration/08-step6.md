Now that your component is ready, letâ€™s edit and build the Docker image that will capture the dependencies of your component.

By typing `mic encapsulate step6`, MIC will attempt to build and test the resultant image, running your component. For example, for our SWAT example you should see the following on your terminal:

```
MIC has created the execution directory /Users/mosorio/tmp/swat_simulation/executions/05_29_15_15_24/src

Added: TxtInOut into the execution directory
Running
 ./run   -i1 /Users/mosorio/tmp/swat_simulation/swat_simulation/data/TxtInOut  -p1 1993 -p2 1
cd TxtInOut'
cp ../swat670 .
chmod +x ./swat670'
./swat670'

MIC creates an `executions` folder where you will be able to see the results of the executed model, which in this case correspond to all the `Added` files listed in the command above.

### Expected results 
After this step, you will have created and validated your executable component. Congratulations! Now all that remains is make it available online
