### Creating the directory skeleton for your first configuration

You must create the directories and sub directories

```bash
$ mic encapsulate step1 <model_name>
```

MIC has created a directory `model_name`.
In this directory, there two subdirectories:
- data: Contains your data/inputs.
- src: Contains the invocation script.
