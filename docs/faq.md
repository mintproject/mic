
## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I create several variations of a component?** 

We recommend generating several components (model configurations). When uploading the components in the last step, you will be able to associate all these model configurations to the same model, relating all of them together.

**What happens if I submit my component twice?** 

Right now MIC does not allow editing model metadata, so if a component already exists, it will be uploaded as a different version.
