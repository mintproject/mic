## Concepts

- **Software Image**: Computational infrastructure needed to carry out a run of a model.
- **Code repository**: Location where the code of a model resides (e.g., GitHub)
- **Model configuration executable**: Executable definition of the . The executable also has a code repository, which may be different from the target model. For example, I may have a model in a GitHub repository and maintain executables in another repository.
- **Model configuration metadata**: Metadata associated to a model configuration: input and output variables, creator, contributor, license, etc.
